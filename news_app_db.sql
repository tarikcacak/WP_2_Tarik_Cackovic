Such an appeal will lack urgency since Trump will face no punishment that risks interfering with his duties as president.\r\n\r\n“A sentence of an unconditional discharge appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality and allow Defendant to pursue his appellate options,” Merchan wrote.\r\n\r\nThe judge also said that he would allow Trump to appear to the sentencing virtually, to assuage the president elect’s concerns about the “mental and physical demands during this transition period.”\r\n\r\n“It was a smart move by Judge Merchan to announce in advance that he is going to impose no punishment, and hold the proceeding remotely, because that undermines any effort by Trump’s team to argue in federal court that sentencing imposes some major burden,” said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said.\r\n\r\nIn his ruling Friday, Merchan repeatedly referenced internal US Justice Department opinions – which are not binding in court, but has applied to the federal government’s conduct – that say that a sitting president cannot be subject to prosecution.

Weiss later indicted Hunter on tax and gun-related charges, but President Biden granted him a sweeping pardon in December before his son was to be sentenced. \r\n\r\nThe Justice Department tacked on additional tax charges against Smirnov in November, alleging he concealed millions of dollars of income he earned between 2020 and 2022, and Smirnov pleaded guilty in December to sidestep his looming trial.  \r\n\r\nSmirnov was accused of falsely telling his FBI handler that executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid then-Vice President Biden and his son $5 million each around 2015. Smirnov\'s explosive claim in 2020 came after he expressed \"bias\" about Joe Biden as a presidential candidate, according to prosecutors. The indictment says investigators found Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017 — after Biden\'s term as vice president.\r\n\r\nProsecutors noted that Smirnov\'s claim \"set off a firestorm in Congress\" when it resurfaced years later as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Biden. The Biden administration dismissed the House impeachment effort as a \"stunt.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Smirnov’s arrest, Republicans had demanded the FBI release the unredacted form documenting the unverified allegations, though they acknowledged they couldn’t confirm if they were true.\r\n\r\n\"In committing his crimes he betrayed the United States, a country that showed him nothing but generosity, including conferring on him the greatest honor it can bestow, citizenship,\" Weiss\' team wrote in court papers. \"He repaid the trust the United States placed in him to be a law-abiding naturalized citizen and, more specifically, that one of its premier law enforcement agencies placed in him to tell the truth as a confidential human source, by attempting to interfere in a Presidential election.\"\r\n\r\nProsecutors agreed to pursue no more than six years against Smirnov as part of his plea deal.

Jim Banks of Indiana laced into Democrats over what he said are attempts to delay confirmation hearings for Trump nominees, in particular that of the Department of Defense pick Pete Hegseth. \r\n\r\nBanks urged Senate Committee on Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., to move forward with Hegseth\'s scheduled confirmation hearing on Jan. 14 as planned and not to be swayed by Democrats\' requests. \r\n\r\n\"As you are aware, Senators who are going to oppose the Hegseth nomination no matter what are seeking to delay and deny President Trump his Secretary of Defense being confirmed quickly. If they are successful, this will harm America’s national security during the crucial transition of power later this month,\" he wrote to Wicker on Wednesday. \r\n\r\nThe Republican\'s letter comes after fellow committee member, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., sent his own correspondence to Wicker, arguing the committee needs more information and documentation from the nominee to properly consider him. \r\n\r\n\"I am deeply concerned that the Senate Armed Services Committee is considering the nomination of Pete Hegseth for this critically significant position without full information regarding his capacity and experience to lead our military and steward a budget of nearly $850 billion,\" Blumenthal said, referencing allegations that Hegseth mismanaged finances while leading a veterans\' nonprofit. \r\n\r\nThe Connecticut Democrat added, \"I do not see how this committee can, in good conscience, consider Mr. Hegseth\'s nomination without a full review of his conduct while leading these organizations - the only civilian management experience of his career.\"\r\n\r\nBlumenthal said he requested additional documents of Hegseth\'s be reviewed, \"including credit card transactions and other uses of resources.\" \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Democrat claimed Hegseth \"refuses to make himself available to meet with me and my Democratic colleagues in advance of his nomination hearing.\" \r\n\r\nHowever, a source familiar told Fox News Digital that Hegseth reached out to Democrats in early to mid-December to meet. The only Democrat who was willing to was Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who sat down with him last month. The others, the source said, waited until days before the scheduled Jan. 14 hearing to respond. As is the case for these types of nominees, Hegseth is scheduled to be in hearing preparation in the days leading up to it. \r\n\r\nIn his letter to Wicker, Banks blasted Blumenthal\'s request. \"Senator Blumenthal’s letter to you and the rest of the Committee is the latest attempt to accomplish their goal. In his letter, he raises unsubstantiated and anonymous accusations against Mr. Hegseth about his time as a leader of two organizations that advocated for America’s veterans. Senator Blumenthal’s letter purposely omits the fact that veterans who have worked with Mr. Hegseth professionally are on the record supporting his nomination,\" he wrote. The Republican acknowledged that Blumenthal has the right to question Hegseth on the floor and ultimately oppose his confirmation. But, \"He does not have the right to delay the Armed Services Committee’s important work for the national security of the United States,\" Banks said.

O’Malley, before the end of his tenure, locked in telework agreements for 42,000 Social Security employees until 2029. \r\n\r\n\"President Donald Trump and his incoming Administration is set to be greeted by largely vacant federal government office buildings because the federal workforce is still taking advantage of the Biden Administration’s outdated and detrimental pandemic-era telework policies,\" Comer told Fox News Digital. \"Not only do these telework policies jeopardize the ability of agencies to deliver vital services to the American people, but reports indicate the Biden Administration is now working with federal employee unions to cement long-term guarantees of telework.\" \r\n\r\nComer told Fox News Digital that President-elect Trump’s \"agenda and critical services provided by the federal government should not be hindered or prevented because of unchecked federal workforce unions that are striking deals with the Biden Administration to stay at home.\" \"It’s past time for the federal workforce to get back to work in-person for the American people,\" he said. \"The House Oversight Committee remains committed to ensuring federal employees show up for the American people they serve.\" \r\n\r\nAccording to a Senate report authored by Sen.

Joe Wilson, R-S.C., chairman of the Helsinki Commission, and Democrat Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., are set to introduce the \"Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act\" on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nFox News Digital has exclusively obtained the bill barring recognition or normalization of relations \"with any Government of Georgia that is led by Bidzina Ivanishvili or any proxies due to the Ivanishvili regime’s ongoing crimes against the Georgian people,\" the bill reads.\r\n\r\nAccording to the bill, \"no federal official or employee may take any action, and no Federal funds may be made available, to recognize or otherwise imply, in any manner, United States recognition of Bidzina Ivanishvili or any government in Georgia.\"Rep. Cohen, who came up with the name of the bill, told Fox News Digital the Georgian Dream has become the Georgian nightmare.\r\n\r\n\"Sanctioned oligarch Ivanishvili’s Georgian Dream party has now become a tool of Putin. They falsified the October election and illegally picked a pliable president. The United States cannot and will not recognize this illegitimate government. The Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act will ensure that the United States does not. Until it agrees to free and fair elections, the Ivanishvili regime must remain fully isolated by all democratic governments.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Georgian Dream government did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comments, the party’s political council released a statement on Wednesday saying the recently imposed sanctions are \"anti-Georgian steps\" orchestrated by the \"Global War Party\" and \"deep state\" networks, calling Rep. Wilson \"one of the most serious manifestations of the deep state\" and \"a degraded politician.\" \r\n\r\nIn its nature and goals, the \"Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act’’ resembles Rep. Wilson-led 2023 \"Assad Regime Anti-Normalization Act,\" which passed last February. The bill was passed in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2025 and was signed into law by President Biden last month. \r\n\r\n\"The Assad Regime Anti-Normalization Act\" too prohibited recognition or normalization of relations with the Bashar al-Assad government. \"It is the policy of the United States not to recognize or normalize relations with any government of Syria that is led by Bashar al-Assad due to the Assad regime’s ongoing crimes against the Syrian people\", the NDAA passage reads.\r\n\r\nThough it is up to the president to recognize a certain government or a leader, lawmakers refer to the existing precedents.

That trio is now joined by the Carrera S—a model that fills the gap between the 388-hp base model and the higher-performance 478-hp GTS.\r\n\r\nThe newest version of the 911 Carrera S features a familiar twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six. However, Porsche added new turbos and optimized the charge-air cooling system, increasing the boxer engine\'s output. While it makes the same 390 pound-feet of torque, its 473 horsepower is 30 more than before. That\'s channeled through an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transmission. Unfortunately, its predecessor\'s seven-speed manual option has been discontinued. Those who desire a third pedal can still get one with the new 911 GT3 or the manual-only Carrera T.\r\nAlong with a top speed of 191 mph, Porsche claims the new fixed-roof model with the available Sport Chrono package will hit 60 mph in 3.1 seconds (two-tenths quicker than before). A 992.1-gen Carrera S coupe we tested with the PDK did the deed in 3.0 seconds flat. While Porsche only shared details about the new rear-drive model, we expect an all-wheel-drive Carrera 4S variant will also join the lineup at some point.\r\n\r\nThe Carrera S comes as either a coupe or cabriolet, and they benefit from the same subtle styling updates as other 992.2 models. For instance, the front bumper features larger air intakes and the matrix LED headlights now package all the elements together. The rear end has a more cohesive design, albeit with a similar full-width taillight.Performance-wise, there\'s a standard sport-tuned exhaust, and the outgoing GTS model donated its brakes. Up front are a pair of 16.1-inch rotors, while the rears measure 15.0 inches. They fit inside the standard set of staggered 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels. Porsche says the Carrera S\'s new dampers provide a better ride and more responsive handling. The optional rear-axle steering includes a quicker steering ratio and helps make the 911 even easier to maneuver. Other add-ons include a front-axle-lift system, Porsche\'s ceramic composite brakes, and the PASM sport suspension that drops the ride height by 0.4 inch.\r\n\r\n', 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2025-porsche-911-carrera-s-103-677d93a8b56db.jpg?crop=0.798xw:0.673xh;0.0952xw,0.209xh&resize=1200:*', '2025-01-09'),

So we can\'t say we\'re too surprised to find out that the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe\'s lineup is expanding to match that of its closest rival. For 2025, the GLE Coupe is now available in a GLE450 4Matic configuration.\r\n\r\nThe coupe body style had previously been limited to higher-performance AMG versions, but this addition brings the GLE in line with the BMW X6, which has a similar xDrive40i model at the lower end of its lineup.\r\n\r\nLike that X6, the GLE450 is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six. The Benz produces 375 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque, pairs with a nine-speed automatic transmission, and comes standard with all-wheel drive. The GLE450 does without the sportier styling of the AMG versions, but still has that same slope-back look that differentiates it from the GLE-class SUV.\r\n\r\nThis new model lowers the price of entry for the GLE Coupe by a significant $15,750, as the next-rung-up 429-hp Mercedes-AMG GLE53 starts at $93,300. The GLE450 Coupe does command a $5050 price premium over the GLE450 SUV, though, so you\'ll have to pay if you want to stand out a bit.\r\n\r\nMercedes says that the GLE450 Coupe went on sale in the last quarter of 2024 and noted that GLE-class sales were up 12 percent in that quarter compared with the same time in 2023.', 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2025-mercedes-benz-gle450-coupe-677d60ec63987.jpg?crop=0.750xw:0.778xh;0.128xw,0.0921xh&resize=1200:*', '2025-01-09'),

Wildfires in the area are unfortunately common, but this one, which began in the late morning today, January 7, has grown at a frightening rate due to the increasing winds.Evacuations were ordered in the neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, which is a hilly, residential area, with only a few major intersections to enter and leave.\r\n\r\nAs people evacuated, the roads became gridlocked, and many residents chose to leave the cars and escape the area on foot. Despite requests from firefighters that vehicles be moved to the side or left with the keys, many cars were left with no way for emergency personnel to move them. As a result, firefighters have had to resort to heavy machinery, bulldozing the abandoned cars off the streets to make way for emergency vehicles. As the news clip below shows, locals including actor Steve Guttenberg were doing their best tonight to spread the word.News images show a red Caterpillar rolling through the smoke to push an Audi and Nissan off the side of the main roads near Palisades Drive and Sunset Boulevard, and officials report moving around 200 cars in this fashion.
